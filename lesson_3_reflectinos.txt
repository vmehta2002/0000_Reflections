This file has been created to capture my learnings from lesson 3 of the Git course.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Some instances where I would prefer to use a remote repository would be:
  - When collaborating with remote colleagues on the same project
  - When concerned about backing up files so they're not lost
  - When working from multiple machines or locations
