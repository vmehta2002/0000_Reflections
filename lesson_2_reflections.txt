1.  What happens when you initialize (git init) a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When a repository is initialized, the directory and its contents are marked as a something to be tracked and accounted for.  In a banking sense, it is like opening a checking account at the bank.  You may have lots of cash and you can give it to the bank.  But without having first opened an account, there is nothing for the bank to track or to be held accountable for.  Creating the repository is analygous to opening the bank account, which now allows you to make a deposit and track any changes.

2.  To make an an initial commit, perform the following:
	
	git add: addes a file to the staging area before the commit
	"git add cake-recipe.txt"

	Then run git status

3.  How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
	repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a temporary working directory that allows you to bundle files together before making a commit so that they can all be committed as a package.  

	This allows the user to keep many files in the working directory without having them to be put in the repository.  

4.	git diff (without argument)	shows difference between file in working directory and last commit

5.  git diff --stage shows difference between file in staging area and commit

6.  3 Different types of diff commands
	git diff (working directory vs. staging area)
	git diff -- staged (staging area vs. commit 1)
	git diff commit 1 commit 2 (commit 1 vs. commit 2)
